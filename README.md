# Work-Day-Scheduler
ADD IMAGE!

This project is a work day scheduler which allows a user to input notes or reminders for each hour of a 9-5 workday. The scheduler will save the note upon click of the save button, and keep it on the page even if the page is refreshed. To clear the schedule, simply erase the note and save again.

Using moment.js I was able to implement the current day which can be found at the bottom of the header. In my javaScript file I was also able to compare the current time from moment.js to the given timeslots on the page and use color coding to display if a given timeslot is in the past, present, or future.


I built this project using jquery and vanilla javaScript as well as html, bootstrap, and css.
